### Terminology
##### Kata

A kata is a challenge that needs to be completed in one or more languages that the kata supports. Completing a kata earns you honor, leading to an increase in your Kyu.

##### Kyu

Your Kyu is your rank. Everyone starts at Kyu 8 and as you earn honor your rank "decreases" and "maxes" at Kyu 1. Katas are ranked in difficulty by their Kyu ranking. Completing a kata of higher Kyu than your current Kyu will earn more honor, whereas a kata with a lower Kyu then your current Kyu will earn less honor.
